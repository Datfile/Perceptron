# Perceptron

This repository contains an implementation of a Perceptron â€” one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

A Perceptron is a binary classifier that maps input features to a single output using a linear decision boundary.

This project includes:
- Python code for training and testing a Perceptron
- Example dataset
- Visualizations (if any)

## ðŸ§© Files

- `perceptron.py` â€” Main code for the Perceptron algorithm.
- `data/` â€” Folder for input data (if you have one).
- `notebooks/` â€” Jupyter Notebooks for experiments (optional).
